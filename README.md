# Image-Classification

Welcome to the world of Image Classification

**Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
This project implements an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify five types of flowers: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the system preprocesses the dataset, designs and trains a CNN model, and evaluates its performance on test data. The trained model is deployed to make predictions on new images, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with the system.

**Key Features**

Preprocessing of flower image dataset, 
Design and training of CNN model architecture, 
Evaluation metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall), 
Deployment of trained model for inference and 
User-friendly interface for image classification

**Technologies Used**

TensorFlow, Keras and Python

**Getting Started**

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/akshitharsola/Image-Classification.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script to preprocess data, train the model, and deploy the system.

**Usage**

Upload images to the user interface.
Initiate image classification to obtain predicted labels.
View classification results and performance metrics.
